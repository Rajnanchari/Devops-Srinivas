### What happens when we turn on computer?

    The power supply sends electricity to the components of the computer, such as the motherboard, hard drive, and fans.
    The BIOS (basic input/output system) or UEFI initializes and performs a power-on self-test (POST), which checks the basic hardware components to ensure they are working properly. If any issues are detected, error messages may be displayed.
    The operating system (OS), such as Windows or macOS, is loaded from the hard drive or another storage device into the computerâ€™s RAM (random access memory).
    The OS then initializes its own components and drivers and presents the login screen or desktop environment to the user.
