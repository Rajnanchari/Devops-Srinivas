# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

## 1) Traditional Waterfall Model
     1.Requirements and Gathering Analysis: Understanding customer requirements.
     2.Design: Using tools and implementing CI/CD pipelines.
     3.Implementation:
                   .Coding
                    .Unit testing
                     .System testing
                     .Regression testing (Longest duration   phase)
      4.Testing: User Acceptance Testing (UAT).
      5.Deployment: Releasing the application.
      6.Maintenance: Bug fixes and support.

## 2) What is Agile Methodology?
     .In Agile methodology, each project is broken into several "iterations".
     .All iterations should have the same time duration (2 to 8 weeks).
      .At the end of each iteration, a working product is delivered.
 ### MVP (Minimum Viable Product): A product with the minimum set of features needed to satisfy early adopters.

## 3) Limitations of Agile
     .Development team wants change, while Operation team wants stability.
     .Development team says: "The code works fine on my laptop."
     .Operation team says: "There is some problem with the code; it   does not work in production."
## 4) Why DevOps?
### Development without DevOps Culture:
     .Release and deploy mismatch.
      .Blame game between teams.
     .Unpredictable issues.
     .Lack of monitoring.
### Development with DevOps Culture:
    .Streamlined Deliveries.
     .Team Collaboration.
     .Continuous Monitoring and Feedback.
## 5) What Needs to Be Done?
### For Developers:
     .Use a system with little or no waiting time.
      .Use a system with updated code.
### For Operations:
     .Ensure the system is up and running most of the time.
       Provide a system that is easy to administer.
      .Implement effective monitoring and feedback.
         Establish robust systems.
## 6) What DevOps Is Not:
     .DevOps is not a role, person, or organization.
      .DevOps is not a separate team.
       .DevOps is not a product or a tool.
       .DevOps is not just about writing scripts or implementing tools.
       
## 7) What is DevOps?
  DevOps is a practice that allows a single team to manage the entire application development life cycle, including:

    .Development
    .Testing
    .Deployment
    .Monitoring
    
## 8) What Does DevOps Do?
    DevOps integrates developers and operations teams to improve collaboration and productivity by:

    1. Automating infrastructure.
    2.Automating workflows.
    3.Continuously measuring application performance. preview
## 9) Skills of a DevOps Engineer
  ### Tools:
    Version Control: GIT
    Continuous Integration: Jenkins
    Virtualization/Containerization: Docker/Kubernetes
    Configuration Management: Puppet/Ansible
    Monitoring: Nagios
## Networking Skills:
    General networking knowledge.
    Establishing connections between containers.
    Port forwarding and container orchestration.
### Other Skills:
     People skills.
     Process skills.
     Customer skills and empathy.
     Cloud awareness.
