Subject-Verb Agreement refers to the grammatical rule that the subject and verb in a sentence must agree in number (singular or plural). This means that a singular subject takes a singular verb, and a plural subject takes a plural verb. Here’s a breakdown of the rules:

1. Singular Subjects Take Singular Verbs
Example: The cat runs fast.

Explanation: "Cat" is singular, so the verb "runs" must be singular.

2. Plural Subjects Take Plural Verbs
Example: The cats run fast.

Explanation: "Cats" is plural, so the verb "run" is plural.

3. When the Subject Is "There" or "Here"
The subject follows the verb, so you use a verb that agrees with the actual subject.

Example: There is a book on the table. (singular subject)

Example: There are books on the table. (plural subject)

4. Compound Subjects (Subjects Joined by "And")
When two subjects are joined by "and," use a plural verb.

Example: The dog and the cat are friends.

5. Subjects Joined by "Or" or "Nor"
If the subjects are joined by "or" or "nor," the verb agrees with the subject closest to the verb.

Example: Neither the teacher nor the students were late.

Example: Either the dog or the cat is responsible.

6. Indefinite Pronouns as Subjects
Some indefinite pronouns are always singular, some are always plural, and others can be either singular or plural depending on the context.

Singular: anyone, everyone, someone, nobody, anything, everything

Example: Everyone is invited to the party.

Plural: both, few, many, several

Example: Many are coming to the event.

Singular or Plural: all, some, most, none, more

Example: All of the cake is gone. (singular, referring to the cake)

Example: All of the cookies are gone. (plural, referring to the cookies)

7. Collective Nouns
Collective nouns (e.g., team, group, family) can be singular or plural depending on whether you're thinking of the group as a whole or as individuals.

Singular: The team is playing well. (the group as a whole)

Plural: The team are arguing among themselves. (individual members of the team)

8. Exceptions and Irregularities
Example: The news is on TV. (Even though "news" ends in -s, it is treated as singular.)

Example: The mathematics is hard. (Same reason as "news.")

9. With "Either" or "Neither"
"Either" or "Neither" can refer to singular or plural nouns based on context, but usually, the verb agrees with the closest noun.

Example: Either the teacher or the students are going.

Example: Neither the students nor the teacher was late.
