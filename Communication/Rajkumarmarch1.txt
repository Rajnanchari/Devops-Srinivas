Good morning, Aja rockstars! skill be job bi aja ki sath !

This is your one and only RJ Raj from DevOps, back on the mic to make your workday a little less boring and a whole lot more fun!

I have a question for you rockstars----"If you could switch job roles with anyone in our office for a day, who would it be and why? Think about it while I take you through some national news headlines. Stay tuned because this show is about to get interesting!"

Riddle Time!
"What is something that you have but can't touch, you can change whenever you want, and you use every day but have never seen me. What am I?"

 Word of the Day
Brook – A small stream.
Example: even today people have to walk milles to search for their thirst.
